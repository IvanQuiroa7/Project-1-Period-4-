        <p>A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.</p>
      <div id="intro">
        <h3 style="color:red">Hardware</h3>
      <p>
      Computer hardware is made up of the equipment used to make up you computer unit. These parts include your monitor, central processing unit (CPU), keyboard, mouse, printer, and modem.
      The computer is an electronic machine that performs the following four general operations: </p>
      </div>
      <ul>
      <li>Input</li>
      <li>Storage</li>
      <li>Prosessing</li>
      <li>Output</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="color:red">Input</h3>
      <p>The input hardware allows you to enter data into the computer. The primary devices used are the keyboard and mouse.</p>
<h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Keyboard</li>
        <p>The keyboard looks like the typewriter. A numeric keypad is located to the right of the keyboard. Numeric keys have the same placement as a 10-key calculator, which allow the operator to enter data rapidly.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>
    <li>Mouse</li>
    <p>The mouse is a device that allows you to control the movement of the insertion point on the screen.</p>
</h4>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:red">Processing</h3>
<h5>
<p>The central processing unit or (CPU) is the "brain" of your computer. It contains the electronic circuits that cause the computer to follow instructions from ROM (read only memory) or from a program in RAM (random access memory). By following these instructions information is processed. The CPU contains three parts.</p>
</h5>
<ol>
  <li> Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU)</li>
   <p>ALU is where the "intelligence" of the computer is located. It can add and compare numbers. To multiply 2 x 4 the computer would add 2 + 2 + 2 + 2. The ALU makes decisions by determining if a number is greater, less, or equal to the other number. Processing is completed in nanoseconds, which is a billionth of a second.</p>
   <li> Memory</li>
   <p>Memory - Two types of memory contained on a chip are RAM (Random Access Memory) or ROM (Read Only Memory). ROM memory has been installed on your computer by the manufacturer and can not be altered. ROM is the memory that determines all the basic functions of the operation of your machine, such as startup, shut down, and placing a character on the screen. RAM is temporary memory, which displays the information you are working on. RAM remembers what you see on your screen while you are working. Today's applications required large amounts of temporary memory, which may require you to upgrade and add more RAM memory.</p>
   <li>Control Unit</li>
   <p>This is the part of the unit, which directs information to the proper places in your computer, such as calculation of information by the ALU unit or to store and print material.</p>
 </ol>
 <h3 style="color:red">Output</h3>
 <p>Output devices such as a monitor or printer make information you input available for you to view or use.</p>
 <h3 style="color:red">Storage</h3>
 <p>Auxiliary storage devices, also called secondary storage devices, are used to store instructions and data when they are not being used in memory. Two types of auxiliary storage more often used on personal computers are floppy disks and hard disks. Also, CD-ROM drives are common.</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Floppy Disks</li>
     <p>A floppy disk is a circular piece of oxide-coated plastic that stores data as magnetic spots.</p>
 <li>Hard Drive</li>
 <p>Much like a floppy, the hard disk located inside the computer case is made of a stack of rotating disks, called platters. Data is recorded on a series of tracks that have been divided into sectors. Most computers have one hard drive, located inside the computer case. If a computer has one hard drive, it is called drive C. If a computer has additional hard drives, they are called drives D, E, and so on. A hard drive stores your programs. When you buy a new program, you must install the program files to your hard drive before you can use the program. A hard drive stores your data files such as documents spreadsheets, and graphics.</p>
 <li> CD-ROM Storage</li>
 <p>Since each CD-ROM can store 600 million bytes of data or 300,000 pages of text, they are today's answer to make you computer feel like a machine twice its size. Because of its external storage, you can use your machine to access an encyclopedia, games, graphics, and a variety of sources that use large amounts of memory.</p>
 </ul>

 <h3 style="color:red">Software</h3>
<p> Computer productivity is determined by programs which are step by step instructions telling the computer how to process data. Software can be divided into two groups, system and application.</p>
<ul>
  <li>System Software</li>
  <p>The operation of your computer is controlled by system software. As you boot the computer, the system software is stored in the computer's memory which instructs the computer to load, store, and execute an application.</p>
  <h4>Some examples of windoows are:</h4>
  <p> Windows 95
    Windows 98</p>
    <li>Word Processing</li>
    <p>Word processing is the most commonly used software in schools, home, and business. A key advantage of word processing software is that users can make changes such as spelling, margins, additions, deletions, and movement of text.</p>
    <li>Database Software</li>
    <p>Database software allows us to store and manipulate large quantities of data using the computer. For example, a database can sort the names, addresses, grades and activities for all of the students in a school. It would be possible to add or delete data and produce printed reports using the database.</p>
    <li>Spreadsheet Software</li>
    <p>Spreadsheets store numeric data that can be used in calculations. A spreadsheet is used to store a teachers grades and then calculate student averages. The primary advantage of a computerized spreadsheet is its ability to redo the calculations should the data it stores be changed. Calculations can be made automatically as formulas have been preset into the spreadsheet</p>
    <li>Desktop Publishing</li>
    <p>Desktop publishing applications allow the user to create newspapers, newsletters, brochures, and similar types of publications. It is similar to word processing except it allows the user to use text, graphics, pictures, lines, shapes, patterns, and borders. Desktop publishing requires more skill and computer knowledge of design and layout.</p>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="color:red">Communications</h3>
  <h4>Modem</h4>
  <p>The purpose of a modem is to send the converted digital signals of a computer to analog signals to send and then convert the analog signals it receives to digital to send the message back to the computer. A modem may be a part of the computer or a stand-alone device that is connected to the computer and phone line.</p?
