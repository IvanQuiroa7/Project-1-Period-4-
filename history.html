        <p style="color:purple">A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.</p>

        <h3 style="color:red">Hardware</h3>
      <p style="background:yellow">
      Computer hardware is made up of the equipment used to make up you computer unit. These parts include your monitor, central processing unit (CPU), keyboard, mouse, printer, and modem.
      The computer is an electronic machine that performs the following four general operations: </p>
      </div>
      <ul>
      <li>Input</li>
      <li>Storage</li>
      <li>Prosessing</li>
      <li>Output</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="color:red">Input</h3>
      <p>The input hardware allows you to enter data into the computer. The primary devices used are the keyboard and mouse.</p>
<h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Keyboard</li>
        <p>The keyboard looks like the typewriter. A numeric keypad is located to the right of the keyboard. Numeric keys have the same placement as a 10-key calculator, which allow the operator to enter data rapidly.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>
    <li>Mouse</li>
    <p>The mouse is a device that allows you to control the movement of the insertion point on the screen.</p>
</h4>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:red">Processing</h3>
<h5>
<p>The central processing unit or (CPU) is the "brain" of your computer. It contains the electronic circuits that cause the computer to follow instructions from ROM (read only memory) or from a program in RAM (random access memory). By following these instructions information is processed. The CPU contains three parts.</p>
</h5>
<ol>
  <il> Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU)</il>
   <p>ALU is where the "intelligence" of the computer is located. It can add and compare numbers. To multiply 2 x 4 the computer would add 2 + 2 + 2 + 2. The ALU makes decisions by determining if a number is greater, less, or equal to the other number. Processing is completed in nanoseconds, which is a billionth of a second.</p>
